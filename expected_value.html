        <p><span class="emoji">📈</span> Understanding expected value is crucial for making informed decisions, especially when it comes to betting on horse races. Expected value (EV) is the average outcome you can anticipate from a particular action if you were to repeat it many times.</p>
        <p>The formula for expected value is:
        $$EV = (Probability \ of \ Winning \times Net \ Profit \ if \ Winning) + (Probability \ of \ Losing \times Cost \ of \ Bet)$$ <span class="emoji">📊</span></p>
        <p>For example, if you bet €10 on a horse with a 30% (0.3) chance of winning and the payout is €30 (net profit of €20), the expected value is:
        $$EV = (0.3 \times €20) + (0.7 \times -€10) = €6 - €7 = -€1$$ <span class="emoji">💸</span></p>
        <p>This negative expected value suggests that, on average, you would lose €1 for every €10 bet placed on this particular outcome over the long run. <span class="emoji">📉</span></p>
        <p>Identifying bets with a positive expected value is the key to potentially profitable betting. This requires careful analysis of the odds and the true probabilities of each horse winning. <span class="emoji">🧐</span> Look for situations where the odds offered by bookmakers are higher than your own assessment of the horse's chances. <span class="emoji">💡</span></p>
        <p>Remember, even with positive expected value bets, there's no guarantee of winning every time. However, over a large number of bets, you are more likely to come out ahead. <span class="emoji">🏆</span></p>
